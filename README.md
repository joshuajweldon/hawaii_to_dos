# Hawaii To-Dos

If you are visiting Hawaii, you must eat the food, visit the beaches, and hike the mountains. Sounds easy, but there is so many options to choose from. So, here is a good list to get you started. 

```
NOTE: I tried to keep the options close to North Shore and Waikiki for convience. Thus some great "hole-in-the-wall" places where omited.
```

---

## Luau

Culture, food, music, dance, FIRE and more! You can't visit Hawaii without going to a Luau. It is a chance to experiance the Hawaiian culture in a truly emersive way. And, there is one place that has it all, The Polynesian Cultural Center. I recommend spend the whole day their, where you walk from "village" to "village", with each representing a different pacific island. Then, at the end of the day, eat Hawaiian food and watch their show, "Ha". The whole experiance is really fun, and the show is beath taking.

```
NOTE: Many of the places below, offer great Vegetarian options.
```

### Hawaiian Food

Laulau, Squid Luau, Kalua Pork, Lomilomi Salmon, Poi, Halpia and more. You can experiance Hawaiian food at a Luau as mentioned above, but if you'd rather eat it at a restraunt Halena's is a great option. You can also find Hawaiian entries on many menu's at local restraunts.

### Local Food

Loco moco, poke, oxtail soup, plate lunch, and shaved ice and more. Hawaii is a meltingpot, and thus "local food" has become a genera of its own. "Local food" can be described as a fusion of Asian, Polynesian, and Western flavors. Here are a two places I recommend.

### Food Trucks

You can get some great food by going to "Eat the Street" events and visiting different food trucks. Here are a few parking locations for the food trucks.

### Fish

Shushimi, Sushi, poke, raw, grilled and steamed! Seafood is such a staple food in Hawaii, and it branches across so many different cuisines. There are so many great places for both raw and cooked fish that it is hard to narrow it down. Here are a few places that I like to go to when I am craving fish.

#### Raw Fish

[__Katsumidori Sushi__](https://www.yelp.com/biz/katsumidori-sushi-honolulu?utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))

[__Ahi and Vegitable__](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ahi-and-vegetable-honolulu-3?utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))

```
NOTE: Hole-in-the-wall, but they get their fish fresh from the market daily giving their food the same quality as most fine dining places, without the price.
```

#### Cooked Fish

### Ethnic Food

Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian and more. Hawaii being a meltingpot gives you access to so many cuisines. Here are a few of my favorite places.

#### Chinese

#### Japanese

## Beaches

Snorkeling, paddle boarding, surfing, and warm sand. Waikiki is a great place to grab a surfboard and hit up some waves for beginners, but there are better beaches to relax and snorkel. Here are a few other options.

[__Waimea Bay__](https://www.yelp.com/biz/waimea-bay-beach-park-haleiwa-2?utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))

![Waimea Bay Photo][WAIMEA]

[__Lanikai Beach__](https://www.yelp.com/biz/lanikai-beach-kailua?utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))

![Lanikai Beach Photo][MOKES]

[__Shark's Cove__](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sharks-cove-haleiwa-3?utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))

```
NOTE: I have never seen a shark here; I believe the name is more to do with the shape. But, there are A LOT of sea turtles. So, you can breath easy while snorkling the best spot on Oahu :P
```

## Hiking

Waterfalls, breath-taking views, nature! Hawaii has beautiful hikes all over the island. Here are a few of my favorite.

[__Maunawili Falls__](https://www.yelp.com/biz/maunawili-falls-kailua?utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))

![Maunawili Fall Photo][WILI]

[__Laie Falls__](https://www.yelp.com/biz/laie-falls-laie?utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))

```
NOTE: This is a longer hike, but you can pick wild fruit along the way. And, once you reach the falls, you will most likely have the area all to yourself.
```

![Laie Falls Photo][LAIE]

[__Kuliouou Ridge__](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kuliouou-ridge-trail-honolulu?utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))

![Kuliouou Ridge Photo][KULI]

[__Kokohead Hike__](https://www.yelp.com/biz/koko-head-honolulu?utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))

![Kokohead Hike Photo][KOKO]

[__Stairway to Heaven__](https://www.yelp.com/biz/haiku-stairs-access-restricted-kaneohe?utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))

```
NOTE: This is a VERY famous hike; however, the entrance to the hike is on private road. So, it is techically illegal to reach the trail. Yet, many people still choose to hike it. In order to hike this trail, you must start at 3AM to avoid "getting caught". 
```

## Shopping

Waikiki is known for it's shopping, but if you are looking for a more local experience, I would recommend visiting some of the "pop-up" farmer markets, or visiting Haleiwa Town in North Shore.
