# Hawaii To-Dos
If you are visiting Hawaii, here is a list of things I recommend you try.

---

## Luau
You can't visit Hawaii without going to a Luau. It is a chance to experiance the Hawaiian culture in a truly emersive experiance. Food, music, dance, FIRE! What more can you want. And, there is one place that has it all, The Polynesian Cultural Center. I recommend spend the whole day their, where you walk from "village" to "village", with each representing a different pacific island. Then, at the end of the day, eat Hawaiian food and watch their show, "Ha". The whole experiance is really fun, and the show is beath taking.

## Food

### Hawaiian Food
Laulau, Squid Luau, Kalua Pork, Lomilomi Salmon, Poi, Halpia and more. You can experiance Hawaiian food at a Luau as mentioned above, but if you'd rather eat it at a restraunt Halena's is a great option. You can also find Hawaiian entries on many menu's at local restraunts.

### Local Food
 Loco moco, poke, plate lunch, and shaved ice and more. Hawaii is a meltingpot, and thus "local food" has become a genera of its own. "Local food" can be described as a fusion of Asian, Polynesian, and Western flavors. Here are a two places I recommend.
